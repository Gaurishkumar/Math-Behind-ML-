## Overview
This research report is part of an ongoing study on the mathematical foundations behind machine learning algorithms. As a member of the Data Science Club at VIT Chennai, I have been exploring the inner workings of various machine learning models, focusing on their theoretical principles and implementation.

## Current Progress
### 1. **Random Forest Algorithm**
   - Implementation of a custom Random Forest model using Decision Trees.
   - Includes feature selection, bootstrap sampling, Gini impurity calculation, and majority voting.
   - Demonstrates the ensemble learning technique to improve prediction accuracy.

### 2. **Linear Regression**
   - Explanation of gradient descent and loss function minimization.
   - Mathematical derivation and theoretical insights into parameter optimization.

## Future Work
- Expansion of the research to cover more machine learning algorithms such as:
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - Neural Networks
  - Gradient Boosting Methods
  - Clustering Algorithms
  - Dimensionality Reduction Techniques
